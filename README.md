# word-imposter
Phone party game, where all players except one know the word. The others have to find out who it is.

## The Rules and How to Play
- Choose from one of the word categories (Actors, Athletes, ...)
- Each player will then receive this secret word/name, except for the impostor
- Now one by one, everyone says a word related to the given word without actually saying it
    - Example: The secret word is Dwayne Johnson. Valid words would be "Actor", "Wrestling", "Male" etc.
- The group can go however many rounds they want
- Afterwhich they decide who they think did not know the word
